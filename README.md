# Image-Classifaction-IEEE-Victories-Competition


‚óè My team got ü•â the third place over 10 teams in the competition of IEEE Victoris 1.0 in the Data Science Track‚óè ü•â The third place over 10 teams in the competition of IEEE Victoris 1.0 in the Data Science Track

Issued by IEEE Mansoura Student Branch Sep 2022

-The competition consisted of 2 phases, filtration phase with only 10 qualifing teams and was on building a prediction system, and a final phase that was on building an image classification deep learning model for such challenging dataset.

-Part of the final phase score was granted through a 7 min pitching made to interpret the life cycle we went through out the project along with our proposed model.

## About this repository:

This repository contains code and resources for image classification using the IEEE Victories Competition dataset. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the IEEE Victories Competition dataset. It consists of a large collection of images across various categories, such as animals, nature, objects, etc. The dataset provides a diverse range of images, making it suitable for training and evaluating image classification models.

## Project Setup

To set up the project and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the IEEE Victories Competition dataset from the provided source or refer to the documentation within the repository for instructions on obtaining the dataset.
3. Install the required dependencies, which may include popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with other necessary libraries. Refer to the provided requirements.txt file or the documentation within the repository for specific instructions.
4. Preprocess the dataset as needed, including tasks such as data augmentation, resizing images, and splitting into training and testing sets. The specifics of data preprocessing may vary depending on the chosen model and requirements.
5. Train the image classification model using the prepared dataset. The code in the repository should provide guidance on how to train the model, including setting up the architecture, specifying hyperparameters, and training configurations.
6. Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its performance and accuracy. The code or documentation within the repository should include instructions on how to perform the evaluation.
7. Optionally, fine-tune the model, adjust hyperparameters, or experiment with different architectures to improve the classification accuracy.
8. Once satisfied with the trained model, you can use it to classify new images or make predictions on unseen data.
