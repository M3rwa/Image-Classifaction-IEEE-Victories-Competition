-The competition consisted of 2 phases, filtration phase with only 10 qualifing teams and was on building a prediction system, and a final phase that was on building an image classification deep learning model for such challenging dataset.

-Part of the final phase score was granted through a 7 min pitching made to interpret the life cycle we went through out the project along with our proposed model.
